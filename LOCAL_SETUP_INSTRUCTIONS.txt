LOCAL DEVELOPMENT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

Your frontend is currently running and connected to a remote backend.
You can access your application at: http://localhost:3000

To set up the complete local development environment with a local backend, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher:
   - Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"

2. Install MongoDB:
   - Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
   - Follow the installation instructions for Windows

3. Install backend dependencies:
   - Open a terminal in the backend directory
   - Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Install uvicorn (if not already installed):
   - Run: pip install uvicorn

5. Start the backend server:
   - Run: uvicorn server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

6. Update the frontend to use the local backend:
   - Edit frontend/.env
   - Change REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL to http://localhost:8000

7. Restart the frontend server:
   - Stop the current frontend server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run: npx yarn start

This will give you a fully local development environment.
